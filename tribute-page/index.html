        <li>Saint Nicholas of Myra (traditionally 15 March 270 – 6 December 343), also known as Nicholas of Bari, was an early Christian bishop of Greek descent from the maritime city of Myra in Asia Minor (Greek: Μύρα; modern-day Demre, Turkey) during the time of the Roman Empire.
        </li>
        <li style="color: olive">Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker.</li> 
        <li>His reputation evolved among the pious, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus <b>("Saint Nick")</b> through Sinterklaas.</li>
        <li style="color: olive">Very little is known about the historical Saint Nicholas. The earliest accounts of his life were written centuries after his death and contain many legendary elaborations.</li> 
        <li>He is said to have been born in the Greek seaport of Patara, Lycia in Asia Minor to wealthy Christian parents.</li> 
        <li style="color: olive">In one of the earliest attested and most famous incidents from his life, he is said to have rescued three girls from being forced into prostitution by dropping a sack of gold coins through the window of their house (in a later version of the tale, down a chimney when he finds the window locked) so their father could pay a dowry for each of them.</li>
        <li>When Martin Luther, the great Protestant Reformer, came along, he wanted to get rid of the Catholic elements of Christmas. To replace Sankt Nikolaus (Protestants don’t emphasize saints!), Luther introduced der Heilige Christ (later called das Christkindl), an angel-like Christ Child, to bring Christmas gifts and reduce the importance of Saint Nicholas.</li>
        <li style="color: olive">Not long after, in England during the reign of Henry VIII, when he was pictured as a large man in green or scarlet robes lined with fur. He typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas <b>("Father Christmas")</b>, bringing peace, joy, good food and wine and revelry. As England no longer kept the feast day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December, the Father Christmas celebration was moved to 25 December to coincide with Christmas Day.
